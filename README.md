## JQuery-based VWCC Help Desk Administrative Page
_2-person team project completed borrowing from already-established Virginia Western Community College website 
design standards and elements via "View Page Source"_

The need for a user page for staff members of the college's Help Desk motivated this project. 
Many tasks were routinely completed, and a **wide** variety of resources regularly accessed day-to-day, 
but no central location existed where all links, applications and scripts were easily accessible.

All initial HTML code and website elements were located via the page source of Virginia Western's (then) website, 
and combed through to eliminate and refactor non-essential content for this project. Then JQuery features and functionality 
were coded in, as jointly decided upon and determined necessary.

##### Features include (starting from top of web page):
* Phone directory link to all college staff and personnel (intentionally blank)
* Link to chat application launched in separate, smaller window  
  to allow staff member continued access to all needed resources
* Password generator, created randomly, for user resets which also provided NATO Phonetic Alphabet  
  for ease of recital to user
* Text field for staff to log general information from caller, on the fly  
  â€“ If determined that a "Help Ticket" needed established, a form could be toggled on via a checkbox  
    and all necessary information relating to the issue could be entered and later tracked for resolution.  
    (Form action was later established when the web page was put into service)
* Tabs established that when clicked would trigger a reveal of links down left side of page, or when hovered over,  
  would reveal same links under each tab, mimicking college's website behavior
* About 25 links determined necessary all accessible relative to tab headings  
  and trigger opening a new page instance, for ease of staff use 
* All behavior, style and placement of elements exactly matched that of the college website  
  to maintain brand identity
